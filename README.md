## 📝 Project Description

This BTP II was conducted as part of the **SAFE – Field Evaluation of Bluetooth Attendance** initiative.

### 📌 Background

The **SAFE** system was initially developed for Wi-Fi-based presence detection in classrooms for attendance and exams. However, Wi-Fi signal leakage beyond classroom walls allowed for possible proxies.

A prior R&D effort by **Manish Kumar** and **Omkar Kadam** introduced a **Bluetooth-based attendance** approach, offering better range control. Our project aimed to evaluate and refine this Bluetooth-based solution through real-world deployments.

## 🛠️ Work Summary

- ✅ **Stress-tested and debugged** the existing Bluetooth attendance implementation.
- 🎨 Made **UI improvements** and critical backend changes across both:
  - **Android app** (Java/Kotlin)
  - **Django-based server**
- 🏫 Conducted multiple **real classroom field trials** to validate Bluetooth effectiveness.
- 🔁 Iteratively **refined the system** based on trial results.
- 🧾 Compiled a detailed documentation of the system architecture, bugs, patches, and outcomes.
