## 📝 Project Description
This project was taken under the **SAFE – Field Evaluation of Bluetooth Attendance** BTP II

### 📌 Background
The SAFE system has previously used Wi-Fi-based scanning to verify classroom presence for attendance and exams. However, Wi-Fi signals can leak beyond classroom boundaries, enabling proxies. A prior R&D project by Manish Kumar and Omkar Kadam implemented Bluetooth-based attendance, which needed further testing and integration.

### 🛠️ Work Summary
- Stress tested and debugged the existing Bluetooth attendance code.
- Made necessary **UI modifications** and backend updates on both **Android and server (Django)** sides.
- Conducted **real classroom field evaluations**, identified gaps, and refined the system accordingly.
- Repeated field trials after improvements and documented the entire process in detail in the report.
